This data is used in Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz, a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. All of these datasets are in the public domain. The dataset contains the cost of a small sample of USA population Medical Insurance Cost, obtained from this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) dataset. The dataset was collected 5 years ago. The purpose of the dataset is to recognise the variations in medical insurances for people based on various aspects such as age, gender, region, etc. As a result, it aims to serve public interest as well as bring about awareness about oneâ€™s choices in medical insurance policies. Moreover, it helps in understanding the functionality of medical insurances, factors that establish a correlation between the high and low costs of medical insurances for people in the United States, and which of these possible factors is the most decisive. The collection of this data is human-generated (and not from the real world) since it is simulated on the basis of demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau, according to the aforementioned book.
