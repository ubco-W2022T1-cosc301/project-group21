All of us have grown up having our parents take care of our insurances, whether it be medical insurance, life insurance, or home insurance. We have been ignorant about these matters most of our lives because we never had to bear these costs on our own. This changed for us after we came to Canada as International Students. We have since then realised how costly it can be to cover Medical Insurance for just oneself. When exploring this dataset, we discovered that there may be various factors such as one's demographic or medical index that correlates to differences in the insurance costs billed to them. We are interested in digging deeper into these data points and analyzing such relationships that may exist between some of these factors and the total charges.
