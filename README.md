## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

All of us have grown up having our parents take care of our insurances, whether it be a medical insurance, life insurance, or home insurance. We have been ignorant about these matters most of our lives because we never had to bear these costs on our own. This changed for us after we came to Canada as International Students. We have since then realised how costly it can be to cover Medical Insurance for just oneself. Insurance is incredibly important to protect one’s family, properties, financial losses and even high medical costs and emergencies. When exploring this dataset, we discovered that there may be various factors such as one's demographic or medical index that correlates to differences in the insurance costs billed to them. We are interested in digging deeper into these data points and analyzing such relationships that may exist between some of these factors and the total charges.

This data is used in Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz, a book that provides an introduction to machine learning using R. All of these datasets are in the public domain. The dataset contains the cost of a small sample of USA population Medical Insurance Cost, obtained from this [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) dataset. The dataset was collected 5 years ago. The purpose of the dataset is to recognise the variations in medical insurances for people based on various aspects such as age, gender, region, etc. As a result, it aims to serve public interest as well as bring about awareness about one’s choices in medical insurance policies. Moreover, it helps in understanding the functionality of medical insurances, factors that establish a correlation between the high and low costs of medical insurances for people in the United States, and which of these possible factors is the most decisive. The collection of this data is human-generated (and not from the real world) since it is simulated on the basis of demographic statistics from the US Census Bureau, according to the aforementioned book.
