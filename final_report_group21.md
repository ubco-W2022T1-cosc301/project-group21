## Exploratory Data Analysis
![Data Description](images/datadescr.png)

This is a visualization of the data analysis of numerical values in the dataset, containing key information such as mean, standard deviation, min and max values of Medical Charges incurred. This provided a general outlook on how numerical data values in the set may be correlated to one another along with the perspective of average values and degree of variance within each numeric category.

![Correlation Matrix](images/corrmatr.png)

The correlation matrix converts all data types to a numeric form and shows how strong the correlations between any two given columns are. This makes it easy to identify potential relationships between categories. As you can see, there is a strong correlation between smoking and charges, somewhat of a correlation between age and charges and bmi and charges.

![Pairplot](images/pairplot.png)

The pairplot visualization further improves our confidence in the correlational strength seen in the matrices by providing a visual aspect to the trend. They can be seen explicitly in the age to charges plot and somewhat in the bmi to charges plot.
