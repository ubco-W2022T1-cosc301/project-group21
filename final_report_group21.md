a) Is there a significant difference in medical costs billed between a smoker and a non-smoker?

There is a noticeably higher amount of medical insurance charges associated with smokers compared to non-smokers. There is a significant difference in the total medical costs of an individual between a smoker and a non-smoker. To understand if the data is statistically significant, an independent samples t-test has to be done by studying the hypotheses stated above.

b) Is there a positive correlation between an individual's age and the medical costs billed by health insurance?

There is a positive linear correlation between an individual's age and the medical costs billed by health insurance. In other words, medical insurance costs are higher with increasing age. To find the effect size of this correlation, a Pearson's correlation test has to be done to study the hypotheses stated above. In the future, this research question could be studied more in-depth with other factors such as BMI or gender which may interact with age to result in particular medical bills.s such as bmi or gender which may interact with age to result in particular medical bills.

## Summary/Conclusion
Through analysing this dataset, we were able to make multiple conclusions on how one's demographic or attribute affects their medical costs billed by health insurance. A common finding was that the beneficiary's charges were with increasing age. Another factor that played into higher costs was that the medical insurance costs of a smoker compared to a non-smoker was substantially higher. Additionally, while we found that the beneficiary's bmi alone had no significant effect on the insurance charges, there were clear distinctions when those bmi's were separated into categories and combined with factors such as smoking. Our data illustrated that obese smokers pay the highest amount of bills compared to the rest of the dataset. Furthermore, we discovered that smoking contributes more than obesity as a factor because non-obese smokers pay more than double the amount that obese non-smokers do. Overall, we concluded that apart from the medical insurance bills increasing with age, there are other health factors such as obesity and smoking that play a much more important role.
